LEDSpicer is a linear LED controller daemon that will handle single color or RGB LEDs connected to different devices.

It allows the execution of animations and profiles and can handle input from the user to interact with the LEDs, 
profiles can be triggered based on different events, user input, network input, game name, etc.

Includes some utilities to make an arcade cabinet more attractive and cool!

>A program to flavor your Arcade project.
